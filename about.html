<p>I graduated from Swarthmore College with a BA in mathematics and economics in 2017. Then I served as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, where I worked on many academic research projects and policy projects for <a href="https://www.michaelgreenstone.com/">Prof. Michael Greenstone</a>. I am now studying in the PhD program in economics at MIT and I aspire to become a professor.</p>
