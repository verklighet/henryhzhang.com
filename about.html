<p>I graduated from Swarthmore College with a degree in mathematics and economics in 2017. Since graduation, I have been a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, where I have worked on many academic research projects and policy projects for <a href="https://www.michaelgreenstone.com/">Prof. Michael Greenstone</a>. In August, I will begin my graduate studies in economics at MIT. I aspire to become a professor.</p>
