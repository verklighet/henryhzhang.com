<p>I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2017, where I studied mathematics and economics. Since graduation, I have been a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, where I have worked on many academic research and policy projects for <a href="https://www.michaelgreenstone.com/">Prof. Michael Greenstone</a>. I aspire to become a professor. This fall, I will begin my graduate studies in economics at MIT.</p>
