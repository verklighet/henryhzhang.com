<p>I graduated from Swarthmore College with a BA in mathematics and economics in 2017. Then I worked as a research assistant to Michael Greenstone at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. I am now a first-year student in MIT's PhD program in economics. I am interested in research topics in economic geography, environmental economics, and macroeconomics. </p>
